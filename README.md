## Staff Roles and Responsibilities in a SOC

When a cyberattack occurs, the SOC acts as the digital front line, responding to the security incident with force while also minimizing the impact on business operations. The SOC team usually consists of security analysts, threat hunters, and networking professionals with backgrounds in computer engineering, data science, network engineering and/or computer science. Common SOC roles include:


- SOC Manager: Acts as the security center leader, overseeing all aspects of the SOC, its workforce and operations
- Security Analyst Tier 1 – Triage: Categorizes and prioritizes alerts, escalates incidents to tier 2 analysts
- Security Analyst Tier 2 – Incident Responder: Investigates and remediates escalated incidents, identifies affected systems and scope of the attack, uses threat intelligence to uncover the adversary
- Security Analyst Tier 3 – Threat Hunter: Proactively searches for suspicious behavior and tests and assesses network security to detect advanced threats and identify areas of vulnerability or insufficiently protected assets
- Security Architect: Designs the security system and its processes, and integrates various technological and human components
- Compliance Auditor: Oversees the organization’s adherence to internal and external rules and regulations
